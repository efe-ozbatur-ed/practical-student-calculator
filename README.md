The software being tested for this portfolio is a multi-purpose calculator with a graphical user interface written in Python for Turkish high school students 
to calculate commonly used variables of formulas in the school assignments of subjects such as physics, math and chemistry. I developed this software back when
I was in high school in Turkey and in Turkish to help me and my friends with high school studies and to gain practical experience in Python, but for readability
purposes I have translated the text to English and added additional comments that explain what is going on in the function blocks.
